This project is part of the
[React Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) program by Udacity.
The main goal here is to show how to utilize [React](https://reactjs.org/) UI library along with [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) 
for more organized state management.

The following topics has been covered in Redux:

- Redux store, actions, reducers and middleware
- [react-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) to connect react components to redux store
- [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) for async dispatch

## Usage
1. `npm install` to install project dependencies
2. `npm start` to start the development server
